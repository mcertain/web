  <meta name="description" content="WhyChat? Because now you can chat with other people from any nearby place that other iOS users exist. WhyChat is similar to other chat messaging applications, but the major difference is that no information is stored or transmitted to the cloud. All messages are sent directly between iOS devices with end-to-end encryption. All of your login information, messages, and file attachments are also stored in an encrypted format on your device once received. So now you're probably asking, what's the primary use case for Why Chat? Well, WhyChat is an ad-hoc chat messaging application for those times when you have either limited or no cellular network connectivity and maybe even no Wi-Fi access point or router to connect to. You really could literally use it anywhere you want: home, school, work, lab environments, an underground bunker, etc... Let's examine a few more of those now.">

WhyChat is similar to other chat messaging applications, but the major difference is that no information is stored or transmitted to the cloud. All messages are sent directly between iOS devices with end-to-end encryption. All of your login information, messages, and file attachments are also stored in an encrypted format on your device once received. To access your private data, someone would first need access to unlock your phone. Then assuming you are logged out of WhyChat, someone would then need your login password to WhyChat to access your data. Even if your data was somehow copied off the phone, it's all stored in an encrypted format using the password that is unique to you. &nbsp;We have no backdoors built in to decrypted your data. If you lose or forget your password, then all of your data is lost too. (Don't worry, you can specify a password hint to jog your memory incase you forget it temporarily.)</p><p>So now you're probably asking, what's the primary use case for Why Chat? Well, WhyChat is an ad-hoc chat messaging application for those times when you have either limited or no cellular network connectivity and maybe even no Wi-Fi access point or router to connect to. So let's talk about a few of the use cases...
</p><p><strong>Airplanes.</strong> Imagine yourself on an airplane seated separately from your friends, family, or business colleagues but you still want to chat with them or exchange files, well now you can with WhyChat! But wait a minute, can't I do that already today? Well, maybe if you happen to be flying over land in a plane equipped with internet access.  However, if you're flying over the pond to another continent or even flying a short distance on a small regional jet you're likely to have no internet access at all.  But let's say you do have Internet access on your plane, then it becomes costly because not only do you need to pay for access but every individual person in your group also must pay. Then once you've all paid, all of your messages must go off the plane to the cloud and then back on the plane from the cloud to the recipient. If you're sending large file attachments it could also take forever considering the limited bandwidth constraints on flights. </p><p>With WhyChat, you only need to pay the one-time fee to purchase the app and you're good to go. Everything is transmitted locally either directly device-to-device OR device-to-router-to-device, so messages and attachments are sent quite quickly. It's all local! And yes, you won't find these features in WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, or even WeChat, LINE, or Viber. All of the major messaging applications typically require a backend cloud server to store and transmit your messages to other users as well as to gather analytics on your usage and serve up ads to you. That's another way that we're a little different. No ads and no parsing your personal data for revenue.</p><p>Yes, yes, the airplane use case is cool but we got a little off track. Yes, you really could literally use it anywhere you want: home, school, work, lab environments, an underground bunker, etc... Let's examine a few more of those now.
</p><p><strong>Home.</strong> Let's say you're upstairs getting some work done or slaving away in the kitchen while your kids or significant other are downstairs playing around on their iPads in the mancave. Unfortunately, cellular reception downstairs is not that great but you've got Wifi covering the whole house! And if you're like my parents, you may live out where cellular reception is generally bad anywhere in the house and they can't even get true broadband yet. Well, hello WhyChat to save the day! With WhyChat, you can still send messages to anyone else in the house over Wifi regardless of how bad the cellular network or even your broadband network (or lack thereof) happens to be.
</p><p><strong>At the Cabin.</strong> You're off on a relaxing weekend at the cabin with your family or friends, but just one problem. The grounds around the cabin and maybe even the cabin itself are huge but the cellular network coverage out there really sucks and there is no cable or broadband internet. Well, as long as you're within Wifi distance of each other which is about 650 feet (or 200 meters) then you should still be able to communicate with WhyChat. Well, as long as those log walls aren't too thick (thick walls and barriers can cut down on the Wifi coverage range).
</p><p><strong>School.</strong> Have you ever been in class or in a lab at school and wanted to be able to chat with other people but those thick brick walls were making cellular connectivity almost impossible. WhyChat comes to the rescue again! Some buildings and barriers around lab environments were purposefully designed to block out cellular signals.  If that's the case, then all you need is a local chat application that doesn't need to send signals outside the room to help you communicate or send your latest lab files. No body carries USB thumb drives anymore do they? No worries, WhyChat can help you transfer your lab results to your lab partner so that he can compile them together and submit them for grading.
</p><p><strong>Work.</strong> The last place you want to be sometimes but WhyChat can make things easier and maybe even a little fun. Bad cellular coverage, got it covered just like anywhere else. That faraday cage in the lab at work is like a bomb shelter and nothing gets out. Well, as long as you're all in the faraday cage together you should still be able to use WhyChat to exchange files and messages to get your work done. And let's imagine the worst case ever, no Cellular and the work Wifi is heavily restricted on what it can access. So your phone essentially becomes a brick...until you install WhyChat. Now you can chat with your office buddies about where everyone wants to head out to for lunch. Oh wait, I guess this is work so you could also send over the latest spreadsheet or TPS reports to your colleagues to review once you're back from picking up that shiny new red stapler after lunch. Oh that reminds me, back to the plane for a second. Let's say you get to escape the office on a business trip but it's a long flight to Europe over the Atlantic. Well, now you can get some work done and chat with your business colleagues on the plane and exchange those TPS reports and PowerPoint presentations on the plane regardless of how close you're seated together.... &nbsp;Ok, that's probably enough use cases for now...</p><p>BUT THERE ARE SO SO MANY MORE...
</p><p>(Even that upcoming trip to the Moon or Mars you've been planning with Elon...)

</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Investors (Yes, please!)</strong></p><p>Does this all sound good to you? In fact, you're so intrigued that you'd love to invest some money in WhyChat to help it grow and get even better? Then please let us know! Development of WhyChat is currently taking place in Northern California near the San Francisco Bay area. We would love to get some office space somewhere around the SoMa area sometime in the future as we grow and add more people. </p><p>WhyChat is currently only supported on iOS devices such as iPhones and iPads but we'd love to get a MacOS X desktop version created next. Once we have the iOS and Mac OS platforms covered, we'd love to have an Android version too. And hey, maybe one day we will go ahead and add a Cloud Backend so that you can continue to communicate while you're no longer nearby your friends. Oh wait, maybe we could create VPN tunnels directly between devices for remote communications so that we could continue to eliminate that cloud. Now that's an idea! Unfortunately, all of this takes time, money, and people. So if you'd like to invest, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:matt@whychat.app">matt@whychat.app</a> so that we can chat more about your interest.</p></div>
